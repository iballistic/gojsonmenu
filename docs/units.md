# Mass
Mass is a fundamental property of matter that causes it to resist a force accelerating it. The SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), which defined in terms of the mass of the international prototype kilogram.

# Speed
Speed is the magnitude of velocity, or the rate of change of position. Speed can be expressed by SI derived units in terms of meters per second (m/s), and is also commonly expressed in terms of kilometers per hour (km/h) and miles per hour (mph).

# Pressure
Pressure is the normal force over a surface. The SI unit for pressure is the pascal (Pa), which is derived as one newton of force over one square meter (1 Pa = 1 N / 1 m2).

# Temperature
Temperature is a comparative measure of thermal energy. The SI unit for temperature is the kelvin (K), which is defined in terms of the triple point of water. Temperature is also commonly measured by degrees of various scales, including Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F).
